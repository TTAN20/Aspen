Aspen Capital Software Engineering Internship Interview <br>

To run my code, first download and extract the Aspen.zip file and open up the folder in your preferred coding platform/terminal. <br>
Second, run the code python3 ./app.py in your terminal, and for every ModuleFoundError download the module that you are missing by running pip install (name of module). <br>
If you don't have pip installed you can install it by running sudo apt install python3-pip <br>
After running the code, the code should run a local server to the address http://127.0.0.1:5000, and then from there you can use the buttons to navigate around. <br>


Post-Mortem Thoughts <br>
I did not have as much time as I would have liked to have spent on this project due to school deadlines and exams, and some of my solutions are a bit crass. <br>
For example, I could have made my html files a bit more presentable and added visuals to show the game being played out. <br>
Also, I noticed that some games in War could theoretically go on forever, so I just shuffled the deck every 100 turns to help limit deadlocks. <br>
Another thing I would have liked to fixed is the style of my code, I coded some methods inefficently where there might be a python library that does it quickly <br>
Overall, I focused on correctness over everything else, and given more time I could maintain correctness while improving efficiency and style. <br>
